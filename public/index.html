			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>This is the running Heroku app that you just deployed using the Heroku Button</p>

			<p>The app happens to be written in Node.js, but Heroku also supports apps written in Ruby, Python, Java, PHP, Scala and Clojure.</p>

			<h2>How did I deploy this app?</h2>

			<p>You clicked a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button">Heroku Button</a>.</p>

			<p>Heroku Buttons link GitHub repos with minimal application setup information - together these allow Heroku to create an application, fetch the source code, deploy the app, configure its environment and deploy any third party add-on services it may use.</p>

			<h2>What's next?</h2>
			<p>Go back to Heroku Dashboard. The app page has details on how you can clone the source code to start hacking on it and build the application that you want.</p>
